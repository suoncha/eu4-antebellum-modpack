 pope_impalement.0.t: "The Martyrdom of the Holy Father"
 pope_impalement.0.d: "The unthinkable has happened. The Holy Father has been murdered by the tyrant of [impaler_country.GetName]. The throne of Saint Peter sits empty, desecrated by an act of supreme blasphemy.\n\nAcross the Catholic world, church bells toll a call to war. The blood of the Pope cries out from the ground for vengeance. The butcher has revealed himself as the Antichrist.\n\nIn his martyrdom, the Holy Father has given the faithful their final, most sacred cause: to unite, take up the sword, and purge this evil from the world."
 pope_impalement.0.a: "Deus Vult! Avenge the Holy Father!"
 pope_impalement.1.t: "The Call to Vengeance"
 pope_impalement.1.d: "A shadow has fallen over Christendom. The Holy Father has been martyred by the tyrant of [event_target:impaler_country.GetName], a man now declared Anathema by the surviving Cardinals. The Church is wounded, its Holy City occupied, but its spirit is unbroken. A great crusade is being called to avenge this blasphemy and purge the Anathema from the world.\n\nThe Papal Legate has arrived in our court, bearing the news and a call to arms. The Church requires soldiers and gold to fund this holy war. As a faithful son of the Church, it is our sacred duty to contribute to this cause. How shall we answer the call?"
 pope_impalement.1.a: "We will spare no expense! For the Holy Father!"
 pope_impalement.1.b: "Our treasury and our men are at the Church's disposal."
 pope_impalement.1.c: "We shall contribute what we can to the cause."
 pope_impalement.1.broke_boy: "We cannot afford to help at this time."
 pope_impalement.2.t: "The Die is Cast"
 pope_impalement.2.d: "It is done. The Pope is dead, his body a testament to our will. The lesson has been taught in the heart of the so-called 'Eternal City'.\n\nWord of our deed spreads across the continent. The remaining Cardinals have branded us Anathema, the accursed enemy of their faith. The Catholic monarchs, once squabbling amongst themselves, now have a singular purpose: our destruction. They call us the Antichrist, a monster to be slain. Our Catholic subjects rise in revolt, and even our own advisors of that faith have turned against us.\n\nWe are alone, surrounded by a world that now hates and fears us in equal measure. There is no turning back."

 pope_impalement.3.t: "The Sword of Vengeance"
 pope_impalement.3.d: "We have answered the call of the Church and joined the great crusade against the Anathema of [impaler_country.GetName]. Our declaration of war is a sacred vow, a promise to the martyred Holy Father that his death will be avenged."
