 AB_wallachia_events.4.d: "The room was lively, the air filled with laughter, song, and the smell of fine dining. The patriarchs of The Ten Houses are all seated along a long marble table, with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] at the head of the table. They were all smiling, laughing, chatting, and telling stories of days long gone. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], however, was staring into the distance, playing with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] food, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] knee shaking with variable intensity. One of the servants approaches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n“Yu...Your Grace?”\n“This better be good,” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] replies without breaking [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze into the abyss.\n“Is there something wrong with the food Your Grace? You haven’t touched it at all...”\n[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] eye begins to twitch. The servant’s hands begin to tremble slightly. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] turns to the servant and smiles.\n“I’m not sure son. Can you check?”\nThe servant lets go of his breath.\n“Of...Of course Your Grace,” says the servant dutifully. He takes a spoonful and tastes it.\n“Hmm, it’s quite nice your grace. Is thi—“\n“It’s from a pig,” interrupted [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n“It’s a bit chewy.” He takes another spoonful. “And it’s cold.”\n“Maybe if you spent more time eating it and less time torturing it, it wouldn’t be so cold!” ribs Logofat Radu.\nThe whole room erupts into laughter. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s eye begins to twitch again, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] quickly begins matching the pace of the rest of the room.\n“Radu! The pig had it coming! It has been embezzling funds from the crown for years!”\nThe whole room howls with laughter. Some men almost fall over from their chairs and choke on their food from laughing so hard. The [Root.Monarch.GetName] laughs with them, scanning their faces and nodding as if to say, ‘Yes... funny, isn’t it? Very funny... ’ The howling goes on for a minute, before [Root.Monarch.GetName], almost instantly, reverts back to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] typical vacant, emotionless expression. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gauntlet and taps on it with a silver spoon.\n“Gentlemen! A toast to [Root.GetName].”\n“Hear hear!” shout The Ten.\n“And to The Great Ten Houses!”\n“Hear hear!!”"
 AB_wallachia_events.5.d: "“Without your grain, without your horses, without your men — no, without your people, we would be lost…”\n“He’s right!”\n\"Which is why I want to… apologize… for what has transpired.\" [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] eye began to twitch. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] paused, forcing a thin smile before continuing, \"I did what I believed was best for the health and security of the realm with the information I was given by my council.\"\n“You’ve got some shite council, that’s for sure!”\n“Hear hear.”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to the man and smiled.\n“Aye and they've since been dealt with.”\nThe room nods in approval.\nI believe the terms discussed here today are more than reasonable. From now on, The Council will have veto power over all decisions made by the crown.”\nThe room begins cheering.\n“And I can’t believe I neglected to mention this, but a toast. To the lost.”\nThe whole room goes silent.\n“Their loss is tragic, but in a way was not for nothing. Without their loss, we likely wouldn’t have made so much progress here today…”\n“You didn’t have to kill my brother to give us veto power!” shouted Radu.\n“Oh don’t be so sad Radu,” chuckles the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nThe room begins whispering.\n“Your Grace!?”\n“What? He’s with all of us here today, in spirit and in body.”\nThe whole room looks at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] like [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe]’s crazy. One of the nobles tries to get out of his seat and head to the door, his legs barely obeying him, trembling with each step, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] quickly turns to him and glares at him. The noble winces and almost begins to sob and sits back down.\n“What, Radu? What’s the matter? You don’t believe me?”\n\tThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] reaches into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stew and pulls out a severed finger and throws it at his face. The patriarch is bewildered by what just happened and doesn’t even register that a human finger hit him in the face before he begins cleaning himself up with his serviette and starts wiping down his lap where the finger landed. The whole situation doesn’t even feel real to him. He examines it and then gasps and drops it on the table, his hands shaking. The whole room erupts into panic and projectile vomiting."
 AB_wallachia_events.6.d: "“Yes, I put your brother, your nephew, your father, your father, his uncle, and your brother into the pot. We used the biggest one we had, and we somehow managed to fit them all in there! Now that you’ve all been reunited in body, it’s time to reunite you in spirit!”\n\tThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] claps [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands loudly three times. The palace guard flood into the room. A scene of pure chaos unfolds. Men are vomiting all over the table. Some try to run past the guard to get to the door but are quickly thrown on the ground. The rest of the men, save two, are swarmed by the guards. The dining hall erupts into shouting and men choking on their own blood. Some of the nobles are held down in their seats and stabbed repeatedly in their chest and abdomen. Others are simply thrown onto the ground and beaten to death. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] calls over some guards. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] points to The Lord of House Cantacuzino.\n“I don’t want a single hair hurt on his head.”\nThe guards secure him from the back of his robe’s collar.\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] then turns and points to the logofat. “Hold the son of a bitch down!”\nThe guards grab the logofat, and quickly press him down onto the corner of the table.\n“Your Grace! Your Grace! Please! No! Your Grace!”\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cupped [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ear with exaggerated flair, a grotesque, almost childlike grin plastered on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] feigned deafness to the patriarch’s desperate pleas.\n“Your Grace! Your Grace! I’m sorry! My brother! Your Grace! Take it! Take all of my titles! Take all of my land! My house’s treasury! Please Your Grace!”\n“Who said I wasn’t going to?”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] turns to a guard standing at the ready, holding his implements. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] takes a steel poker from him.\n“Your Grace! You cannot do this to us! Have you no honor!?” The Lord Cantacuzino shouted. \n\tThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] lets out an exasperated sigh. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] turns away from the logofat and walks towards him with the poker in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand. The lord looks down and begins shaking. His face contorts and a tremble takes control of his lips. The screams of the other lords still fill the dining hall, but he could sense every footstep the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was taking towards him. Once he saw [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] boots, he closed his eyes and prayed he wouldn’t be there once he opened them. He felt [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cold fingers pressing up the bottom of his chin. He opens his eyes and sees [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cold, vacant eyes. He tries to move away but the guards are holding him firmly in place.\n“Look at me Petru.”\nPetru looked down, his body beginning to shake."
 AB_wallachia_events.7.d: "“Look at me Petru or I’ll have them take out your eyes.”\nThe lord looks into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] eyes were still and focused on him. You could move the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to another world, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze would still feel fixed upon you. \n“Do you know what your problem is?”\n“Your Grace?”\n“I said do you know what your problem is?”\n“I… Your Gra—“\n“If I have to repeat myself again...”\n“We...we trusted you…?”\n“Well yes, obviously, but it goes beyond that.”\n“I...We...Er…”\n“Your problem, and this goes for all of you, is that you went into this assuming that I can’t do something. As if God himself was holding me back,” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] lectured while [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wagged the poker in the lords face. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] strode back to Logofat Radu, yanked his head up from the table, then turned [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze back to Lord Cantacuzino.\n“What you should have done is prepared for what I could do. That was your mistake”\nRadu begins pleading again with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n“Your Grace! No! Your Grace! You can’t do this! You must hang us! You can— ahhh AHHHHHH!”\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] begins slowly driving the poker into poor Radu’s eye. The screams are so loud, the others pause for a moment to glance at the vile scene—then quickly look away to avoid being next. The ruler slowly twists the poker while it’s still embedded, intensifying the shrieks. Then, with a swift yank, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] rips the eye out. The screams reach a crescendo.\n“Do you see? DO YOU SEE!? DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CROSS ME!?”\n“Your… Your Grace... Please... No mo—“\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] jabs the poker into Radu’s other eye. It looks as though the poor man might slip into unconsciousness from the blood loss, but the pain jolts him back. Another scream rips from his lungs. When the second eye is pulled free, the noble begins to wail."
 AB_wallachia_events.8.d: "“Maammaaa! Maaamaa please! Help me mama! Ahhhh mama please!” he sobs, blood leaking from his ruined sockets.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] turns to the guard—who is now visibly petrified—and takes a pair of iron tongs, rusted from years of use by the blacksmith. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] grabs a dull table knife from the banquet setting.\n“Open his mouth.”\nThe guards pry it open easily. His tongue is already chewed and bloodied from pain-induced biting.\n“What’s the matter? Don’t approve of your brother’s stew? Don’t worry, friend. I’ll get rid of the taste.”\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] clamps the tongs onto Radu’s tongue and yanks it forward with one hand, while sawing at its base with the other. The noble can only gargle helplessly on the blood filling his mouth.\n“That’s the problem with you lot — too much talking. Not enough listening. Turn the bastard’s head.”\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] grabs a candle from the table and begins pouring the wax down into his victim’s ear canal. A final blood-curdling scream escapes before the man goes limp in the guards’ grip.\nDispleased that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] plaything gave out too soon, the Voivode begins striking his skull repeatedly with the metal candlestick holder, shouting curses with each blow.\nBy dawn, all ten patriarchs of the noble houses are impaled in the town center. Their corpses are mutilated—except for Lord Cantacuzino who was made to endure the full pain of impalement. He tries to scream, but the stake has already pierced his jaw. The people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] walk past the spectacle. The children cry. The adults only cover their mouths and noses to ward off the stench. None speak.\nBeside the stakes stands a wooden sign, freshly painted. It reads:\n\n“Those who think treasonously speak treasonously.\nThose who speak treasonously act treasonously.\nThose who act treasonously end here.”"

To our own people, they are the 'curse' of the Balkans, the architects of centuries of suffering.

 AB_wallachia_events.23.d: "They arrived at my church in [krushenieto_province.GetName] three nights ago, a family of ghosts. The wife, Elena, told me they were farmers from a village near Sofia. When I asked what brought them so far from home, the word itself seemed to break her, and she began to sob. Her husband, Stefan, held her, but his comfort was a hollow gesture. He was staring at a corner of the room, his face a blank mask of stone.\nI knew some great horror had befallen them, but I could not reason it out. The Tartar raids do not reach so far south. The infidel corsairs keep to the sea. The war with the Vlachs, they say, is over. What new devilry could have sent them fleeing with such terror?\nI gave them what little space I have—a few straw pallets on the floor of the sacristy. There is no privacy in grief. At night, I hear the children scream. Elena smothers her sobs into a threadbare blanket. But Stefan... Stefan makes no sound at all. When I woke this morning, I found him awake, staring at the empty pallet where I had slept. His eyes were an abyss.\nOver a meager breakfast of bread and broth, I finally broke the silence. \"Stefan,\" I said gently, \"what has happened? The war is over.\"\nFor a long time, he said nothing. Then, a whisper, so quiet I almost missed it, escaped his lips.\n\"...The Krushenieto.\"\n\"The what?\" I asked, leaning closer.\nHis face, a mask until now, began to crack. His jaw trembled, his eyes squeezed shut. \"The Shattering,\" he choked out. \"The war ended. The peace began.\"\nHe spoke of the Vlach soldiers returning to their village. Not to garrison, but to cleanse. He spoke of church doors being barred from the outside, the smell of smoke, the sound of prayers turning to shrieks. He spoke of neighbors forced to watch as their families were mounted on stakes, a harvest of flesh. By some miracle, he gathered his wife and children and fled into the woods as the howls of his world died behind them.\nThey lived on roots and vermin, hiding by day and moving by night. They searched for other villages, but found only ash. Then, one day, they came upon a clearing in the forest.\n\"It went on for miles,\" he whispered, his voice raw. \"A forest of stakes. Not soldiers. Farmers. Wives. Children... so many children. Their bodies... God forgive me, their bodies were not whole. The things they had done...\"\nHe stopped, his breath catching in a sob.\n\"But the smell,\" he finally continued, his voice a haunted rasp. \"The smell is what broke us. The sweet, foul stench of blood and bowels and burned flesh... It clings to you. It fills your lungs when you try to breathe, it coats your tongue when you try to pray.\"\nHe looked at me then, his thousand-yard stare finally focusing on my face. \"I close my eyes, and I am back in that forest. I can still smell it, Father. I will always smell it.\""
