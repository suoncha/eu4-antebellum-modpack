 wallachian_terror_events.4.d: "The palace guards form a square around you and your family as you flee into the chaos consuming the streets of [impaled_country.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The air is thick with smoke, blood, and the stench of human waste. You begin to dry heave. Ahead, your guards march in blood-spattered armor. Behind you, your family stumbles in ruined finery — beautiful clothes soaked in mud and gore. The cobblestones beneath your feet are slick with a black, tar-like mixture of blood and soot. Bodies line the streets. Some are still alive. Hands reach from the muck, grasping at your legs, pleading for help. You stop looking down. Above, the impaled hang like ornaments. Their screams echo through the alleyways, nearly drowned out by the clang of [impaler_country.GetAdjective] steel as your guards clash with soldiers at every corner. Blow after blow, the formation buckles. You and your family are shoved, rattled, and pressed inward. The square tightens — tighter, tighter still — until it collapses into a triangle of flesh and shields. One by one, the guards fall. But by some miracle, what's left of them cut a path out of the city. You ride. You don't look back."

 wallachian_terror_events.6.d: "\"Right this way, everyone!\" Your family and court follow you toward the wine cellar, confusion plain on their faces. The screams of the dying and the thunder of cannon fire echo through the palace halls. You tell them to grab candles. Once in the cellar, you order the guards to move the giant wine barrel from the corner. It takes five of them. Behind it, just a wall. The men turn to you and wait. A pause. \"Well?\" \"Your Grace?\" says the head guard. \"Kick the bloody thing.\" He stares. \"The wall?\" \"Yes, the fucking wall! The secret passage isn’t inside the wine barrel, now is it?\" They begin kicking with their heels, but the bricks don’t budge. \"No, no — move aside. Bloody hell...\" You take a few paces back and charge, slamming both feet into the wall. The center bricks collapse, and you hit the floor with an undignified yelp. Guards rush to help, but you wave them off. \"I'm fine, I'm fine. Fucking hell... Kick down the rest of it!\" The bricks crumble, revealing a dank, dusty passage. It's pitch black, save for the candlelight. As you move through, the ground trembles with the battle above. Dust falls from the ceiling. One advisor turns to you, scowling. \"You had this the whole time and didn’t tell us? What if something happened to you? Who would’ve known?\" You smirk. \"Well, it wouldn’t be a secret passage if I told the whole bloody court, now would it?\" He shakes his head. You press on through the tunnel. At last, a ladder. You climb, push open the hatch, and emerge into a cow field. You head for the farmhouse. The owner is waiting — and hands you the horses you’d paid to keep there. You ride."

We'll straighten you out soon enough, 'Your Holiness'.”\n“Who, my [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon]? Me?”\n“Yes, you. The heretic.”\n“According to whom?”\n“According to every Patriarch of the True Faith, from Novgorod to Alexandria.”\n“Ah, the Patriarchs,” the Pope said, nodding slowly. “The same men who watch in silence as you butcher Christian kings—men ordained by God Himself. The same men who avert their eyes as you slaughter innocent women and children—”\n“Their innocence is not for you to judge—”\n“—and I wonder, how many of those men will dare to speak of the depravity you have unleashed here today? How many will even acknowledge it happened? You ask me to accept the judgment of these silent men?”\n“You’ll accept what I tell you to accept.”\n“Just like your Patriarchs.”\n“I can have your tongue cut out. It wouldn’t impede the execution at all.”\n“Yes, but you would never silence me.”\n“No. Nobody’s going to remember you, I’ll make sure of it. And the rest of your congregation? They’re going to learn. They always learn in the end.”\n“There’s no doubt in my mind they’ll learn to fear you, but they’ll never accept you. Even the most broken galley slave would prefer working the oar to death than abandoning the Lord Almighty. There will always be whispers of what you’ve done. You may control them. Your son may control them. Even his son. But your dynasty is a line of mortal men. All it takes is one weak link. One mistake. And the dam will break. The faithful will rise, and they will make the unborn children of your people pay for the sins you have committed here today. A tide of blood to answer a tide of blood.”\n“That’s fine. I would have put them all to the stake anyway for failing the Empire. And we don’t need them to love us. Fear is good enough. It got us to where we are today, after all.”"

 wallachian_terror_events.20.desc_impaler: "The Pope’s weary smile returned, but this time it was laced with an almost unbearable sadness. “Are you sure, my [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon]? Are you truly sure you don’t need someone to love you?”\n\n The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stared, brow furrowed, eyes darting briefly around the room, as if searching for an explanation. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] let out a short, sharp chuckle of condescension and turned to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men.\n\n“No,” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] announced to the room. “I am certain I struck him too hard.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] soldiers erupted in sycophantic laughter. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] joined them, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own laugh a sharp, barking sound that didn't reach [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] turned back to the Pope, the smug look returning to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face, ready to deliver another verbal blow, but it died on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lips. The Pope’s gaze was still locked onto [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and in their depths was a profound, bottomless sorrow. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s smirk faltered, then vanished.\n\nThe Pope’s voice was soft, almost a whisper, yet it cut through the room. “There is still someone who truly loves you.”\n\nThe laughter died instantly. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stared at him for a few seconds.\n\n“What are you talking about?” the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] snarled.\n“God still loves you, my [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon]. Even after everything you’ve done.”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] looked away. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] eyes began tearing up, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mouth quivering. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] looked back at the Pope. The Pope’s face slowly shifted from one of profound sorrow to a loving, kind one. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] calmly walked around the table to the Pope and then struck him in the face with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gauntlet again, knocking him down and out.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] went on top of the unconscious Pope and began viciously beating him. The beatings continued for over a minute, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cursing him with each strike. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was finished the Pope’s head was unrecognizable. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sat there on top of him sobbing uncontrollably for a few minutes before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] got up, brushed off clumps of hair and skull fragments from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands and walked out of the room as if nothing had happened."

There is no coming back from this.” the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] whispered.\n“Perhaps my child, but you can still do right by the Lord while you still live. Even if it doesn’t save your own soul, you are saving the souls of your children and your nation.”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] looked away and thought for a moment."

 wallachian_terror_events.21.d: "“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have done it. [PAP.Capital.GetCapitalName] has fallen. The city is ours.”\n\nThe advisor’s voice is a mixture of awe and trepidation. He continues his report.\n\n“Our spies confirm the Pope remains within the Apostolic Palace. He has made no attempt to flee. He is... waiting.”\n\nYou look past the advisor, toward the heart of the captured city, a cold smile touching your lips. You speak a single, quiet command.\n\n“Tell the men to begin construction. I want a forest of stakes tall enough to cast a shadow over his palace.”\n\nThe advisor goes pale, stumbling back as if physically struck. He falls to his knees, hands clasped before him.\n\n“Your Grace! Forgive me! Your wisdom is the light that guides this nation, your will is our sacred command! We are but humble instruments to enact your grand design...”\n\nHe takes a ragged, shuddering breath, his eyes fixed on the floor.\n\n“But... my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]... the council, in its infinite duty to you, has considered the... consequences. Of this particular course of action. Their assessment—and it is merely a humble offering for your consideration!—is that the repercussions will be... absolute.\nThe Catholic kings will not see this as the death of a rival. They will see it as the murder of their spiritual father. They will not rest. They will not bargain. They will come for us with the fire of true belief in their hearts, and they will not stop until our cities are ash and our people are scattered to the winds. It is... a possibility we felt you must be made aware of. I beg you... forgive my presumption. I am nothing.”"
