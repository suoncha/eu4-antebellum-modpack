 wallachian_civil_war_events.1.t: "The Boiermiea's Ultimatum"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.1.d: "Your Grace, I have received a troubling message from the Boiermiea of Câmpulung. It appears they are displeased with you rooting out the traitors and embezzlers in the noble houses — the bastards. I apologize dearly, and I do mean dearly for the wording of this letter sir, I... I'm sure you'll teach them all a very valuable lesson on respect, Your Grace... Erm.. Yes, the letter reads:\n\n\"Your Grace,\n\nIt has come to our attention that you have brought forward charges of treason and embezzlement against [wallachian_civil_war_events_boiermiea_ultimatum_accused_houses] Do you take us all for fools, Your Grace? Do you think we can't see what's going on here — your acting outside your purview? You know full well you are supposed to summon the Council for matters such as these, yet you acted alone anyway. [wallachian_civil_war_events_boiermiea_ultimatum_treasonous_relative] I have spoken with the heads of the other ten houses, and we have all come to an agreement. You will release all of the accused so that they may stand trial before the Council, you will restore all titles and estates to my late brother, and the rest of the accused, and you will agree to reparations for those who were illegally tortured and executed before they could stand trial before the Council. You have three days to send word of your response. Failing to do so outside of extraordinary circumstances will leave us no choice but to mobilize our forces and march on [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\n\nGod save [Root.GetName],\nLogofat Radu Brancoveanu.\"\n\nHow shall we respond, Your Grace?"
 wallachian_civil_war_accept_the_ultimatum: "We cannot afford to have a war with the Boiermiea now..."

 wallachian_civil_war_events.2.t: "The War of the Ten Houses"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.2.d_refused: "As promised in their ultimatum, the Boierime of the Ten Houses have mobilized. Their banners blot the horizon, and their armies march toward [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] with fire in their hearts and treason on their tongues. They come not to negotiate, but to dethrone. What began as whispers in Câmpulung has become a full-blown rebellion, and the nobility has cast aside all pretense of loyalty. The palace guard brace for the siege, and the streets of the capital grow quiet as the people wait to see who will rule [Root.GetName] — the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], or the oligarchs who seek to wear [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] crown."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.2.d_banquet: "The garden is full now. Ten stakes, ten bodies — and ten noble houses with blood in their eyes. Word of the massacre spreads faster than the screams faded. Leaderless but not broken, the Boierime rally their banners. Sons, nephews, distant cousins — all cry out for vengeance. The war that now begins is not a war for power, but for reckoning. And they are coming for your throne, [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Not to debate. To avenge."
 wallachian_civil_war_start_refused_option: "The traitors will drown in their own blood!"
 wallachian_civil_war_start_banquet_option: "Yes, come have a seat with your friends in the Garden..."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.7.t: "The Serfs Caught in the Middle"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.7.d: "With the realm consumed by civil war, the serfs of [This.GetName] have ceased paying taxes to the crown. Not out of allegiance to the traitors, but because men loyal to the rebel houses now ride through the countryside — armed, demanding payment, and punishing those who resist. Our coffers suffer, but to punish the serfs would mean striking at those already living in fear. The question is no longer what is just, but what is necessary."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_serfs_ignore_tax_evasion: "Let them be. The lords won't be collecting for long."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_serfs_enforce_tax: "Treason funded is treason rewarded. Make an example."
 wallachian_civil_war_kill_them_all: "Impale the men, torch the homes, salt the fields. Let the survivors remember why they kneel."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.8.t: "An Opportunity in [voivode_country.GetName]"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.8.d: "Our agents and informants paint a grim picture in [voivode_country.GetName]. The tyrannical rule of their [voivode_country.Monarch.GetTitle], [voivode_country.Monarch.GetName], has ignited the flames of widespread rebellion. The land bleeds, and face enemies from within their own borders.\n\nThis chaos in [voivode_country.GetName] presents a tantalizing opportunity for us. A chance to weaken a troublesome rival, perhaps decisively. Shall we discreetly aid those who fight against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], or is direct meddling too great a risk for [Root.GetName] at this time?"
 wallachian_civil_war_support_rebels_with_manpower: "Send volunteers. Our men can turn the tide."
 wallachian_civil_war_support_rebels_with_cash: "Send coin. Gold can fuel a lengthy rebellion."
 wallachian_civil_war_dont_support_rebels: "Let them bleed. We gain by their weakness regardless."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.9.t: "The Racovita Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.9.d: "Word has reached us that House Racovita has raised its banners in open revolt. Though not the most prominent among the boyar families, they have long resented our disregard for the Council and the impalement of their kin. Led by Mihai Racovita, they now march under the pretense of restoring tradition and justice — though in truth, they smell blood in the water and mean to secure a place for themselves in whatever follows."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.9.d: "House Racovita has risen in fury after the Banquet. With their patriarch butchered alongside the others, they have cast aside the trappings of diplomacy and rallied what men and gold they could muster. Ion Racovita, once a distant cousin with no claim to power, now proclaims himself the sword of retribution — and promises to drape the walls of Târgoviște in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s entrails. Another fire has been lit, and [Root.GetName] continues to burn."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.9_option: "Let them come. Their blood will nourish the Garden."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.10.t: "The Movilesti Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.10.d: "House Movilesti has declared open rebellion. Descendants of an older order, they have long considered themselves guardians of custom and tradition. Vasile Movilesti, a stern old noble with ties in the eastern borderlands, now raises his banner against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], condemning the collapse of due process and the crown's descent into tyranny. His voice may be aged, but the swords answering his call are many."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.10.d: "The Banquet has spilled over into the east — House Movilesti has risen in a fury of blood and fire. Stefan Movilesti, whose uncle was among the impaled, now calls for holy vengeance and the dethronement of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by force. Their banners bear neither plea nor parley, only black cloth and sharpened steel. One more noble house joins the war to decide the fate of [Root.GetName]."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.10_option: "Let them follow their fathers to the stake."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.11.t: "The Mavrocordatos Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.11.d: "House Mavrocordatos has taken up arms. Long styled as stewards of governance and men of learning, they now denounce the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as a despot who scorns the rule of law. Constantin Mavrocordatos, once an advocate of reform, now speaks of justice by the sword. His scribes draft manifestos while his bannermen march westward."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.11.d: "The banquet's crimson echoes reach the libraries and salons of House Mavrocordatos. Alexandru Mavrocordatos, a noble of letters, has cast off his pen and taken up the blade. His father's skull lies impaled before the family estate, and his reply to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s treachery comes not as parchment, but steel. They rise not in petition, but in fury."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.11_option: "They will have their justice — and we will give it to them on the stake!"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.12.t: "The Ghica Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.12.d: "The halls of House Ghica no longer echo with debate — only the clatter of arms and the calls of marshalled men. Radu Ghica, ever the political animal, has cast his lot with the rebels, vowing to see the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stripped of his crown. The House demands a reckoning for what they call 'the tyrant's overreach' and mobilizes to deliver it."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.12.d: "The ghastly sight of Ghica elders impaled has ignited a fire in their blood. Andrei Ghica, once seen as a man of indulgence, now rides at the head of a column of avengers. He calls no council. He sends no letter. There will be no trial or tribunal — only steel and fire. The name Ghica now marches not as a family, but as a vendetta."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.12_option: "Let them come. We will add more names to the garden."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.13.t: "The Cantacuzino Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.13.d: "House Cantacuzino, proud and calculating, has emerged from its silence. Petru Cantacuzino denounces the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as a tyrant and calls for the restoration of noble privilege and honor. Their forces rally with chilling efficiency — every levy called, every mercenary paid, every grudge remembered. They do not rise in haste, but with purpose."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.13.d: "When the heads of House Cantacuzino were dragged from the feast and planted in the garden, it was not just a massacre — it was a declaration of war. Gheorghe Cantacuzino rides under a banner stained with the blood of his kin. The house now fights with no demands, no petitions, no speeches. They march only for vengeance."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.13_option: "They'll join the others who crossed me."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.14.t: "The Bibescu Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.14.d: "The old Bibescu blood runs hot. Dumitru Bibescu has declared that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has violated not just law, but tradition itself. In Oltenia and beyond, their banners rise — those loyal to old customs, old titles, and the sanctity of the boyar elite. They claim to fight for order, but they march for power."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.14.d: "They say the cries from the banquet chamber echoed through the halls for hours. Florin Bibescu, heir to his murdered kin, now leads his house in open revolt. What began as a dispute over power has become a holy vendetta. To them, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is no longer a ruler — only a butcher to be brought to justice."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.14_option: "Let them choke on their ancestors' blood."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.15.t: "The Draculesti Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.15.d: "Sorin Draculesti — cousin to princes, heir to old battles — has taken up arms. The Draculesti banner now flies above rebel camps, its crimson bathed in the blood of pride and betrayal. They denounce the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as a pretender, a tyrant who shamed their name by bypassing tradition and authority. Now they rise not only for power, but to reclaim their legacy from a crown they no longer recognize."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.15.d: "The banquet was supposed to be a negotiation. It became a slaughter. Vlad Draculesti, whose kin were among those butchered, has called for vengeance. His partisans whisper that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has forsaken [Root.GetName]'s nobility, its soul — and now the House of the Dragon returns fire for fire. This is no longer a rebellion. It is retribution."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.15_option: "Let the dragons come."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.16.t: "The Danesti Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.16.d: "Incensed by your refusal to acknowledge the Council's authority, House Danesti has taken up arms. Mircea Danesti denounces your rule as illegitimate and accuses the crown of trampling over noble tradition. Backed by disgruntled bannermen and lesser houses eager to protect their status, they now rally their forces in open defiance."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.16.d: "Barbu Danesti has emerged as one of the loudest voices condemning the slaughter at the banquet. He declares that no [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who butchers [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] guests can claim the right to rule, and calls for your removal by sword and stake if need be. What began as outrage has now crystallized into rebellion — one that seeks to avenge the fallen and remake the principality in their image."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.16_option: "Let them come, and let them die."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.17.t: "The Basarab Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.17.d: "For House Basarab, your refusal to heed the demands of the noble Council was the final insult. Long claiming ancestral rights over [Root.GetName], they now rise not merely to protect their privileges, but to restore what they see as their rightful supremacy. Their banners are unfurled, and their allies march with them — this is more than defiance, it is a bid for the crown."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.17.d: "The massacre of the banquet has thrown House Basarab into a fury. Neagoe Basarab accuses you of desecrating the very soul of [Root.GetName] and swears to avenge the slain lords with fire and steel. His men gather in growing numbers, fueled by grief and righteous hatred, to challenge your rule and bury your legacy under the weight of noble blood."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.17_option: "Let them come. The stakes are ready."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.19.t: "The Proposal of House Racovita"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.19.d: "The doors to the throne room creak open. A courier from House Racovita steps forward — uninvited, yet untouched. Clad in modest silks with trembling hands, he bows deeply and produces a letter sealed with blood-red wax. 'My masters send their regards, Your Grace. They offer you a choice.' The letter is brief, written in a sharp and practiced hand. With titles now stripped of meaning and the gallows still warm, gold is the only currency left worth trusting. For the right sum, House Racovita will keep its swords sheathed and its banners furled. No loyalty, no oaths — just coin."

Word arrives that another upstart noble, a man of little renown but much foolish ambition, has dared to raise a standard of revolt in one of our outlying regions. His forces are insignificant compared to the great families, a gnat buzzing in defiance. But a gnat can still bite, and such audacity, if left unpunished, might inspire others.

They treat us as carrion to be picked over, but they will soon learn the price of their audacity and their attempts to dictate the fate of our realm!"

The arduous struggle to cleanse [Root.GetName] of its deeply entrenched corruption – the embezzlers among the nobility, the self-serving within the clergy, and the greedy among the burghers – faced its ultimate test when the Boiermiea, those paragons of avarice, issued their insolent ultimatum. They demanded yet more power, more avenues to betray the realm and fatten their own purses.\n\nOur [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], in an act of righteous defiance that will echo through the ages, refused to bow to their treasonous demands. This forced the hand of the conspirators, who then revealed their true colors by plunging [Root.GetName] into open war. But their cowardly rebellion was no match for the loyal forces rallied under our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s unyielding leadership.\n\nOne by one, the Ten Houses and their misguided followers have been crushed on the field of battle. Stability is restored, the legitimacy of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] shines brighter than ever, and the era of unchecked aristocratic power is decisively over. [Root.GetName] now stands ready to forge a new destiny, guided by the singular, resolute will of its victorious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\"\n\n...How does that sound, Your Grace? Oh... you like it?

 wallachian_civil_war_events.39.d: "The dispatches from [Root.GetName] speak of an end to the rebellion, but the words curdle the blood and freeze the soul. The one they now call the Butcher of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], stands triumphant. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] victory was not sealed on a noble field of battle, but in a hall of feasting turned abattoir, where the patriarchs of the Ten Houses were lured into a trap of unimaginable depravity – their trust repaid with torture, their bodies desecrated, their end a prelude to the stakes that now greet the dawn in their capital.\n\nWith all opposition now silenced by blade, by terror, by the sheer, soul-crushing weight of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sadism, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] holds absolute sway. What future awaits [Root.GetName], and any unfortunate enough to fall under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] shadow? One shudders to contemplate it. When a ruler demonstrates such a capacity for calculated cruelty, such a thirst for torment, and is then granted unchecked power, the realm becomes little more than a canvas for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] darkest appetites. Every soul within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] grasp is but a plaything for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] whims.\n\nIt is said that the very air in [Root.GetName] is thick with fear, that children no longer laugh, and that the only prayers uttered are desperate pleas for an end, any end. One cannot help but wonder if the Almighty, in His infinite mercy, might not see fit to unmake this blighted corner of the earth, to send a cleansing flood to wash away the stain of such a reign, rather than allow this nightmare to fester and spread. For what hope remains when the Butcher holds the scepter, and all humanity can do is bear witness to the dawn of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] terrible age?"

 wallachian_civil_war_events.40.d: "\"Let the bells of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] ring not in mourning, but in liberation! The tyrant, [Root.Monarch.GetName], who in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arrogance sought to trample the ancient rights of the Boiermiea and rule by fiat, has met [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] deserved end. When we, the united Houses of [Root.GetName], presented our just ultimatum – a demand for lawful process, for the restoration of rights so grievously violated, and for an end to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] overreach – [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] chose defiance. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] chose war over reason, tyranny over justice.\n\nAnd so, war it was. A war forced upon us, a war to preserve the very soul of [Root.GetName] from the clutches of a despot. Today, that struggle concludes. Defeated, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] armies scattered, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has surrendered. Though [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] crimes were manifold, and many cried out for a death fuelled by the same barbarity [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sought to inflict, the Council of the Ten Houses has decreed a more... fitting end. Not the hidden shame of a dungeon, nor the quick release of a blade in the dark. No, [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall face the people [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wronged.\n\nBy order of the Council, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been given an honourable death, as befits [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] station, yet a public one, as befits [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] crimes. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has been hanged in the great square of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], a solemn spectacle to mark the end of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] misrule and the restoration of lawful governance under the guidance of the Boiermiea. Let all who witness it understand: the rights of [Root.GetName] are sacrosanct, and no ruler, however high, may defy them with impunity. A new era begins, an era of order, an era of justice, an era of the Boiermiea.\"\n\n- Proclamation of the Council of the Ten Houses."

 wallachian_civil_war_events.41.d: "\"The fall of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has delivered the Butcher, [Root.Monarch.GetName], into our hands. For the architect of the unspeakable Banquet of Blood, for the fiend who sought to drown [Root.GetName] in terror, death would be too swift a mercy. The Avenging Council of the Ten Houses has decreed a punishment to match the enormity of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] crimes – a slow, public unraveling.\n\nStripped bare before the eyes of all, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was first anointed with the filth and pig's blood that so aptly symbolized [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign, a baptism of shame administered by the grieving kin of those [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] butchered. Now, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is bound to a post in the main square, a permanent fixture of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own capital. His restraints are engineered for perpetual discomfort, a constant, gnawing agony that stops just short of delivering the release of death. Here, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] remains, exposed to the elements, fed only scraps fit for pigs. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] water, clean enough only to prolong [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wretched existence, is offered in a rough stone trough at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet, forcing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to crane [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] neck and lap at it like a beast for every sip – a daily ritual of abasement. No soul may speak to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis], offer comfort, or even meet [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze for long, lest they face summary execution.\n\nYet, when the agony grows too great or the despair too deep, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pleas for a quick end sometimes pierce the square’s grim silence – hoarse whispers or desperate cries. Each such request is met with a swift and brutal punishment from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] jailers. More often than not, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head is roughly seized and plunged deep into the very pig's trough from which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must drink, held under amidst [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] struggles until breath gives out and consciousness teeters, only then to be violently yanked up, gasping and choking on the foul dregs. This 'baptism of the swine,' alongside other torments like a sudden, vicious tightening of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bonds or a day where even [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pitiful rations are denied, serves as a sharp, terrifying lesson against hope or appeal. Every week, the families [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wronged return to cast fresh refuse upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis], a relentless reminder of their undying hatred and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] utter helplessness.\n\nMonths may pass, or perhaps even years. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] mind will surely shatter before his body finally gives way. This is not mere punishment; it is the meticulous deconstruction of a tyrant, a living monument to the Boiermiea's terrible justice, ensuring that the Butcher of [Root.GetName] endures a hell of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own making, visible to all, until nothing remains but a broken, forgotten thing.\"\n\n- From the Annals of the Boiermiea."
