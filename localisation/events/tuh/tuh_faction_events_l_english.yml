 tuh_faction_events.0.t: "The Brancoveanu Infrastructure Initiative"
 tuh_faction_events.0.d: "Representatives from House Brancoveanu, ever mindful of the foundations of our realm's prosperity, have approached the Council of the Ten Houses with an ambitious proposal. They advocate for a significant investment in infrastructure across [Root.GetName]: roads, bridges, and perhaps even new marketplaces, arguing it will stimulate growth and ease administration for generations to come. While the long-term benefits are clear, such an undertaking requires substantial upfront resources. Rejecting their vision, however, may not sit well with such an influential house."
 tuh_faction_events.0.a: "An excellent proposal! Let the building commence."
 tuh_faction_events.0.b: "Regrettably, the state cannot commit to such an endeavor at this time."
 tuh_faction_events.1.t: "Bibescu's Grand Reconciliation"
 tuh_faction_events.1.d: "House Bibescu, ever attuned to the delicate dance of diplomacy, has presented a bold strategy to the United Houses. They propose a sweeping diplomatic campaign aimed at mending fences and fostering goodwill with all our neighbors simultaneously. This 'Grand Reconciliation,' they argue, would significantly reduce regional tensions, improve our standing, and open new avenues for cooperation. Such an ambitious undertaking would require considerable diplomatic capital and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s full support. However, to dismiss this vision could be seen as a diplomatic misstep, potentially damaging our prestige and certainly offending House Bibescu."
 tuh_faction_events.1.a: "A bold vision for regional harmony! Let us proceed."
 tuh_faction_events.1.b: "Such a grand gesture is beyond our current means or focus."
 tuh_faction_events_1_tooltip: "Every neighboring country will lose §G5§! §YAggressive Expansion§! against us and gain §G10§! opinion of us."
 tuh_faction_events_2_more_legit_than_byz_tooltip: "We have more §YLegitimacy§! than @BYZ §Y[BYZ.GetName]§!."
 tuh_faction_events.4.t: "Blood on the Training Grounds"
 tuh_faction_events.4.d: "A joint military exercise between regiments loyal to the Draculesti and Danesti houses has ended in bloodshed. Accounts are contradictory and venomous. The Draculesti commander claims his forces were executing a necessary, aggressive maneuver when the Danesti line broke in cowardice, leading to a fatal collapse.\n\nThe Danesti captain retorts that the Draculesti treated the drill as a real battle, using reckless force that shattered formation and got men killed. Now, both houses demand justice and the censure of the other. The army, the very pillar of [Root.GetName], is split by this feud. As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetName] must intervene, but any decision will have severe consequences."
 tuh_faction_events.4.a: "The Draculesti are our spear. They must be kept sharp."
 tuh_faction_events.4.b: "The Danesti are our shield. Their discipline is paramount."
 tuh_faction_events.4.c: "Both houses have failed me. Both will pay the price."
 tuh_faction_events.4.draculesti_option: "My own house is beyond reproach. The Danesti will learn their place."
 tuh_faction_events.4.danesti_option: "My own house is beyond reproach. The Draculesti will learn their place."
 tuh_faction_events.5.t: "The Quill or the Sword?"
 tuh_faction_events.5.d: "The Sfatul Domnesc is deadlocked. The Ghica family, masters of administration, propose a radical overhaul of the state bureaucracy. They argue that our government is inefficient and bloated, and that by streamlining state functions and reducing costs, we can build a more modern and effective nation. Their plan, however, requires significant cuts to the military budget.\n\nThe Cantacuzino house, whose power is rooted in their vast levies, is outraged. They see the Ghica proposal as a dangerous fantasy that will leave [Root.GetName] defenseless. They demand not cuts, but an expansion of the army, insisting that only a large, well-funded military can guarantee our survival. The state cannot afford to fund both a bureaucratic revolution and a massive army."
 tuh_faction_events.5.a: "A modern state requires an efficient administration."
 tuh_faction_events.5.b: "Our survival depends on the strength of our army."
 tuh_faction_events.5.c: "We cannot afford such radical change now. Maintain the balance."
 tuh_faction_events.5.ghica_option: "The future is forged by the pen, not the sword. My house is correct."
 tuh_faction_events.5.cantacuzino_option: "A nation without an army is no nation at all. My house is correct."
 tuh_faction_events.6.t: "A Legacy of Wisdom or Power?"
 tuh_faction_events.6.d: "Two of our most powerful houses have proposed competing grand projects to secure the future of [Root.GetName]. The Mavrocordatos family advocates for the founding of a National Academy in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], a center for learning and innovation that they claim will make us the most advanced nation of our time.\n\nConversely, the Racovita family argues that knowledge is useless without the power to act. They propose funding an elite diplomatic corps, trained to navigate the treacherous courts of Europe, reduce our infamy, and secure favorable treaties. Both are monumental undertakings that will require significant state investment. We must choose which vision to fund."
 tuh_faction_events.6.a: "Knowledge is the only true foundation for an empire."
 tuh_faction_events.6.b: "Borders are drawn with ink before they are drawn with swords."
 tuh_faction_events.6.c: "Our treasury is too strained for such grand ambitions."
 tuh_faction_events.6.mavrocordatos_option: "My house will usher in an age of enlightenment for our people."
 tuh_faction_events.6.racovita_option: "My house will teach this nation the art of the possible."
 tuh_faction_events.7.t: "The Image of the Court"
 tuh_faction_events.7.d: "A seemingly minor dispute over court etiquette has spiraled into a point of honor between two great houses. The Basarab faction, appealing to their ancient lineage, insists that we restore the old, traditional ceremonies of the Wallachian court. They argue this will reinforce the legitimacy of the Voivode and remind the nobility of their roots.\n\nThe Bibescu faction counters that these old ways are provincial and will make us look like backwater barbarians to the rest of Europe. They demand we adopt the more sophisticated, cosmopolitan customs of the great western courts to improve our diplomatic standing and impress foreign envoys. How we present ourselves to the world versus how we present ourselves to our own people has become a matter of intense debate."
 tuh_faction_events.7.a: "Our legitimacy is rooted in our own traditions."
 tuh_faction_events.7.b: "We must present a modern face to the world."
 tuh_faction_events.7.c: "This bickering is beneath the dignity of the Sfatul Domnesc."
 tuh_faction_events.7.basarab_option: "The traditions of my ancestors will be the law of this court."
 tuh_faction_events.7.bibescu_option: "My family will ensure this court is respected, not ridiculed."
 tuh_faction_events.8.t: "A Matter of Patronage"
 tuh_faction_events.8.d: "A skilled cartographer has arrived at court seeking a noble patron. The Brancoveanu house wishes to employ him to create detailed maps of our domestic provinces, arguing it will aid in future development and tax collection. The Movilesti, however, want him to map the trade routes of the Black Sea, insisting this knowledge will be far more valuable for our merchants.\n\nWhile the cartographer's work is of high quality, his services are not essential to the running of the state. This is less a matter of national policy and more a contest of prestige between two houses vying for influence over the cultural life of the court."
 tuh_faction_events.8.a: "Map our own lands. Internal knowledge comes first."
 tuh_faction_events.8.b: "Map the trade routes. Foreign wealth is our goal."
 tuh_faction_events.8.brancoveanu_option: "My family will patronize this man. His work will serve our interests."
 tuh_faction_events.8.movilesti_option: "My family will patronize this man. His maps will guide our merchants."
 tuh_faction_events.9.t: "The Tyranny of [tuh_highest_influence_house]"
 tuh_faction_events.9.d: "The delicate balance of the Sfatul Domnesc has shattered. [tuh_highest_influence_house] has become a tyrant in all but name, its influence so absolute that the other nine houses are reduced to mere spectators in the governing of their own nation. State offices are filled only by their loyalists, laws are written for their sole benefit, and the treasury has become their private coffer.\n\nThe breaking point has come. A coalition of the slighted houses has formed in secret, their whispers of dissent turning to cries for justice. They have armed their retainers and inflamed the passions of the common folk, who now see the [tuh_highest_influence_house] as the source of all their woes. An armed mob, led by the banners of nine noble families, now surrounds the palace. They demand an end to this tyranny, by any means necessary."
 tuh_faction_events.9.a: "This is treason! We will not bow to mob rule."
 tuh_faction_events.9.b: "The balance must be restored. I will pay the price."
 tuh_faction_events.9.a_tooltip: "§RThe other 9 houses will revolt!\nUp to 9 random provinces will receive:§!"
 tuh_faction_events.10.t: "Superstition, Fear, and Jealousy"
 tuh_faction_events.10.d: "The halls of Tîrgoviste's court echoed with grim whispers as a weary messenger stumbled into the great chamber, his face pale and his cloak muddied from haste. With shaking hands, he handed over a parchment bearing dire news to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seated upon his dark throne. Silence gripped the room as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] read the words, each more dreadful than the last.\n\n'My lord,' the courtier trembled, 'dark witchcraft has taken hold in our lands. Villagers speak of hexes, curses, and shadows stalking the night. Fear and panic spread faster than the plague, and many believe the witches aim to overthrow the righteous order of our realm. What shall we do, your grace?'"
 tuh_faction_events.10.a: "Set up an inquisition and get to the bottom of these rumors."
 tuh_faction_events.10.b: "We have more important things to deal with."
 tuh_faction_events.10.c: "Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches in the name of House Draculesti!"
