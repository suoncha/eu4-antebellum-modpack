 tuh_events.2.t: "The Blood of Emperors"
 tuh_events.2.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], your ascension marks a moment of profound historical significance. While our branch of the family has long been established in the Danubian principalities, the roots of House Cantacuzino run deep into the heart of the Second Rome. Known here by their original Greek name, §YKantakouzenos§!, your ancestors were not mere nobles; they were Emperors, such as John VI Kantakouzenos, who wore the Purple and ruled this Roman Empire.\n\nTo the Greek populace and the ancient aristocracy, your reign is not a foreign conquest but a restoration. The name Cantacuzino carries a weight of legitimacy that no other house can claim. This unique heritage bridges the gap between our Vlach authority and the old imperial establishment, granting us unprecedented stability and influence within these hallowed walls. As long as a Cantacuzino rules from Constantinople, our dominion over the old Roman heartlands will be seen as a birthright, not a conquest."
