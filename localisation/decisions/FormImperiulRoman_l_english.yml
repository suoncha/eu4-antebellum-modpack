 wal_form_imperiul_roman_desc: "The great work is complete. The last pretender to the Roman name lies broken in the dust. The final meter of imperial soil has been reclaimed. From the cold shores of Britannia to the sands of Mesopotamia, from the Pillars of Hercules to the fertile banks of the Nile, all lands that were once Roman are now ours. The blood of Vlach warriors has washed the world clean and restored the legacy of Trajan. The age of petty kingdoms is over. The age of the Empire has returned. It is time for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to make the proclamation that will echo for eternity. It is time to restore the Imperiul Roman."
