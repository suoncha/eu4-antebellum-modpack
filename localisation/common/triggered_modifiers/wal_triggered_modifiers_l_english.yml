 wal_hired_bulgar_adm_advisor: "A Servile Administrator"
 desc_wal_hired_bulgar_adm_advisor: "To place a Bulgar in charge of the realm's administration is an insult to the natural order. The nobility seethes at the idea of taking orders from a member of the underclass, and the populace questions a state that elevates one of the subjugated. Our very legitimacy is undermined by this baffling appointment."
 wal_hired_bulgar_dip_advisor: "Our Bulgar Diplomat"
 desc_wal_hired_bulgar_dip_advisor: "Our voice on the world stage now belongs to a Bulgar. Foreign courts see this not as a sign of tolerance, but of internal weakness and contradiction. The nobility is humiliated, our diplomatic standing suffers, and the realm questions the wisdom of a ruler who sends a servant to speak for masters."
 wal_hired_bulgar_mil_advisor: "A Bulgar in Command"
 desc_wal_hired_bulgar_mil_advisor: "A Bulgar now advises our High Command. The Vlach officer corps, drawn from the nobility, sees this as an unforgivable betrayal. They question his loyalty and refuse to entrust their lives to a man from a people we have crushed."
