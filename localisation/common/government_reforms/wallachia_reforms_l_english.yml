 wallachian_voivodate: "Wallachian Voivodate"
 wallachian_voivodate_desc: "Though crowned by the Church, the Voievod of Wallachia rules only with the consent of the Boiermiea. To govern is to balance ambition against their ever-watchful eyes."
 wallachian_autocracy: "Wallachian Autocracy"
 wallachian_autocracy_desc: "Having decisively crushed the rebellion of the Ten Houses, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has shattered the entrenched power of the Boiermiea and forged a new order in Wallachia. Whether through righteous defiance on the battlefield or by a singular, terrifying act of pre-emptive annihilation, the outcome is the same: the aristocracy is broken, their ancient privileges curtailed or extinguished, and their capacity to challenge the Crown utterly dismantled. Under the Wallachian Autocracy, all authority now emanates from the Voivode alone. The state is an extension of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] will, the Terror a finely honed instrument of control, and the path to absolute dominion lies clear. This is not merely a restoration of monarchical power, but its elevation to an unprecedented, unassailable peak, built upon the ashes of noble ambition and the fear of a cowed populace."
 appointive_voivodate: "Appointive Voivodate"
 appointive_voivodate_desc: "The disastrous outcome of the War of the Ten Houses has irrevocably altered the nature of rule in Wallachia. With the Voivode's power shattered and the Terror dismantled, the triumphant Boiermiea has ensured that no single ruler shall ever again wield such unchecked authority. Under the Appointive Voivodate, the hereditary principle is abolished; upon the death of a Voivode, the Council of the Ten Houses convenes to select a successor from among their ranks or other favored candidates. While this system may occasionally elevate individuals of notable administrative or diplomatic skill, it ensures the perpetual dominance of the aristocracy. The Voivode now rules at the pleasure of the Boiermiea, their authority constrained, their ambitions curtailed, and the dream of absolute power a distant, forbidden memory."
 dacian_kingdom: "Dacian Kingdom"
 dacian_kingdom_desc: "The proclamation of Dacia and the crowning of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] marks a new chapter, yet the ancient currents of power flow on. Though the Vlach lands are united under a royal banner, the Boiermiea of old, now Dacian nobles, still view their rights and influence as sacrosanct. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wears a crown, but [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule over this vast kingdom remains a careful negotiation, balancing the aspirations of a unified Dacia against the entrenched privileges and watchful eyes of a powerful aristocracy. The scale is grander, the title more august, but the art of governance is still one of navigating the ambitions of the great houses."
 dacian_autocracy: "Dacian Autocracy"
 dacian_autocracy_desc: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Dacia reigns supreme. Having decisively crushed the rebellion of the Ten Houses, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has shattered the entrenched power of the Boiermiea and forged a new order in [Root.GetName]."
 wallachian_elective_monarchy: "Wallachian Elective Monarchy"
 wallachian_elective_monarchy_desc: "The Voivode's ambition has been checked. In the face of a united Boiermiea, the crown has been forced to concede, forging a new and precarious order. Hereditary right is abolished, replaced by the deliberation of the Sfatul Domnesc, where the Ten Houses now hold the true power of the state. Henceforth, the Voivode will be chosen from among their ranks, ensuring their interests are forever intertwined with the fate of Wallachia. This is not a partnership of equals; it is a leash, a constant reminder that the Voivode rules only with the consent of the very nobles they once sought to command."
 mechanic_romanian_elective_monarchy_yes: "Upon the ruler's death, select a successor from one of the Ten Houses.\nThe §YDominance of the Boierime§! privilege no longer has any penalties."
 mechanic_no_absolutism_from_boier_privileges_yes: "§YBoiermiea§! privileges no longer reduce §YAbsolutism§!."
 mechanic_can_only_marry_subjects_yes: "We can only form royal marriages with our subjects."
 wallachia_codification_of_the_pravila_reform: "Codification of the Pravila"
 wallachia_codification_of_the_pravila_reform_desc: "The realm is a patchwork of ancient customs and boyar privileges. To forge a true state, we must establish a single, unified legal code—a Pravila—for all our subjects. This will centralize justice under the voivode's authority, but the estates will see it as a direct assault on their traditional rights."
 dacian_roman_empire: "Dacian Roman Empire"
 dacian_roman_empire_desc: "The Roman Empire is restored. The Emperor commands legions from Hispania to Persia. The great Vlach houses who followed the imperial banners now style themselves as a new Patrician class. They view this reborn Empire as a shared conquest, their ancient rights magnified to an imperial scale. The Emperor's authority is projected across the known world. Within the halls of power, governance remains a delicate act of balancing the state's needs against the ambitions of its most powerful families."
 dacian_roman_autocracy: "Roman Autocracy"
 dacian_roman_autocracy_desc: "The will of the Emperor is the sole law of the Roman Empire. This new imperium is built upon the ashes of the old aristocracy, its foundations laid during the brutal subjugation of the Ten Houses. That decisive victory became the template for a new form of Roman governance. Every province, every legion, and every subject understands the lesson taught to the Boieri. Power is absolute, centralized, and enforced without mercy. The state is a weapon. The Terror that secured Dacia now secures the world."
 supremacy_of_the_armasie: "Supremacy of the Armasie"
 supremacy_of_the_armasie_desc: "To combat the endemic corruption of the Boieri and the lawlessness that plagues our lands, we shall elevate the office of the Armasie. This institution will serve as the Voivode's unwavering instrument of justice, a national gendarmerie with the authority to investigate, prosecute, and punish any subject, regardless of rank. Their presence will ensure order is kept, the state's authority is absolute, and that all know the price of defiance."
 unlocked_abolition_of_the_boiermiea_tt: "We have completed the mission §YThe War of the Ten Houses§!." 
 abolition_of_the_boiermiea: "Abolition of the Boiermiea"
 abolition_of_the_boiermiea_desc: "The War of the Ten Houses is over. The Boieri chose treason and have paid the price in blood. Now, I must ensure their ambition can never threaten me again. I will formally abolish the Boiermiea as a political class. Their titles are forfeit, their lands seized, and their ancient privileges erased from the law. At long last their power belongs to me."
 absolute_control_reform: "Absolute Control"
 absolute_control_reform_desc: "The old structures of governance, built on the flawed premise of shared power, are obsolete. I have reforged the realm in my own image. The state is a living extension of my authority. All power flows from my throne, and the bureaucracy exists only to execute my commands with perfect, unquestioning efficiency."
 unlocked_absolute_control_reform_tt: "We have completed the mission §YAbsolute Control§!."
 bulwark_of_the_faith: "Bulwark of the Faith"
 bulwark_of_the_faith_desc: "In a world of heretics and heathens, our Orthodox faith is our greatest shield and sharpest sword. We shall declare ourselves the ultimate defenders of the faith, placing the Church at the heart of our state. This holy alliance will grant us divine legitimacy and a zealous populace, but it will make the clergy a power unto themselves."
 state_appropriation_of_the_robie: "State Appropriation of the Robie"
 state_appropriation_of_the_robie_desc: "For centuries, since their arrival in our lands, the Romani people have been held in a state of enslavement known as Robie. This institution has made them the property of boieri, monasteries, and the Crown itself, their labor forming the bedrock of our economy. We will now perfect this system by appropriating all enslaved persons as exclusive property of the state, creating a centralized workforce to fuel an unprecedented economic boom at the cost of enraging the elites whose 'assets' we have seized."
 mechanic_blocks_humanist_ideas_yes: "We cannot take §YHumanist§! ideas with this reform active."
 state_appropriation_of_the_robie_warning_tooltip: "§RWARNING: TAKING THIS REFORM WILL REMOVE THE HUMANIST IDEA GROUP!§!"
 has_not_abolished_slavery_tooltip: "We have not abolished slavery."
