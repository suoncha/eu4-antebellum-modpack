 dacian_elective_monarchy: "Dacian Elective Monarchy"
 dacian_elective_monarchy_desc: "The Kingdom of The United Houses of Dacia is born not of one will, but of ten. Forged in the struggle between the Voivode and the Boieri, this system enshrines the power of the great houses into the very foundation of the state. The Rege wears the crown, but sovereignty is a shared burden, held in trust by the Sfatul Domnesc. The monarch is chosen from among the great families, ensuring that no single dynasty can claim absolute authority. To govern Dacia is to navigate a labyrinth of favors, rivalries, and ancient loyalties, where the greatest threat to the state often comes from within the council chamber itself."
 roman_elective_monarchy: "Roman Elective Monarchy"
 roman_elective_monarchy_desc: "The Roman Empire rises anew, shaped by the vision of the Ten Houses and the enduring authority of the Sfatul Tarii. The Principate’s legacy of autocracy has evolved into a system grounded in tradition, consensus, and shared power. The Emperor, bearing the august title, serves as First Among Equals, elected by the great houses and answerable to their united will. The game of influence, once rooted in the Danubian principalities, now spans continents, guiding the course of global affairs. This is the age of the United Houses, a Roman Empire defined by collective ambition and the intricate balance of power."
 empower_the_diet_of_the_ten: "Empower the Sfatul Tarii"
 empower_the_diet_of_the_ten_desc: "By formalizing the rights and responsibilities of the Ten Houses in a Great Charter, we replace chaotic ambition with structured competition. This ensures stability and prevents the destructive infighting that has plagued our past, creating a predictable political order for generations to come."
 mechanic_rem_higher_legitimacy_candidates_yes: "The base §YLegitimacy§! of candidate princes will be increased by §G+10§!."
 mechanic_rem_no_pretenders_after_election_yes: "Pretender rebels will not spawn after a ruler is elected."
 dominance_of_the_ruling_house: "Dominance of the Ruling House"
 dominance_of_the_ruling_house_desc: "A state with ten heads is a hydra, not a kingdom. To govern effectively and project strength, the house of the reigning Voivode must be granted primacy over the others. Their will must be the guiding hand of the state, their resources amplified to meet the challenges we face."
 mechanic_rem_ruling_house_monthly_influence_yes: "We will gain §Y+0.05§! monthly §YFaction Influence§! for the house of our current ruler."
 ghica_bureaucracy: "Ghica Bureaucracy"
 ghica_bureaucracy_desc: "The administrative methods pioneered by House Ghica have proven remarkably efficient. By royal decree, we shall make their system the standard for the entire realm, granting them permanent oversight of the state bureaucracy. This blatant favoritism will surely cement their influence for generations to come, regardless of which house holds the throne."
 wallachia_carpathian_ambush_doctrine_reform: "Carpathian Ambush Doctrine"
 wallachia_carpathian_ambush_doctrine_reform_desc: "Let the invaders come. The mountains are our greatest fortress. We shall adopt a strategy of evasion, scorched earth, and ambush, bleeding our enemies in the forests and passes of the Carpathians. Our armies may be less effective in a pitched battle, but the war will be won by the enemy's empty supply wagons and shattered morale."
 wallachia_establish_the_pandurs_reform: "Establish the Pandurs"
 wallachia_establish_the_pandurs_reform_desc: "The borderlands must be our first line of defense. We will organize the free peasants and lesser nobles of the frontier into a permanent militia, the Pandurs. These hardy infantrymen will garrison our forts and defend their homes with unmatched ferocity, ensuring our realm can recover its strength even as invaders break themselves against our walls."
 recognize_dniester_host: "Recognize the Dniester Host"
 recognize_dniester_host_desc: "The untamed lands along the Dniester are home to the Cossacks, fierce and independent communities of horsemen. By formally recognizing their Host and granting them lands and self-governance, we can harness their martial prowess as a bulwark against our enemies. In exchange for their service as the realm's premier cavalry, we must accept their autonomy, the loss of tax revenue from their lands, and the deep resentment of our own boieri, who see these upstart warriors as a threat to their ancient privileges."
 phanariot_cadre: "The Phanariot Cadre"
 phanariot_cadre_desc: "The Vlach boieri are too ambitious and self-serving to be trusted with the state. We will look to the Phanar district of Constantinople, recruiting skilled Greek administrators who owe their loyalty to their position, not to a local dynasty."
 expand_executive_powers: "Expand Executive Powers"
 expand_executive_powers_desc: "The Voivode must be more than a chairman for the boieri's debates. His authority must be his own, not merely borrowed from the Diet. This reform strengthens the Crown's prerogative, allowing the Voivode to issue decrees and act decisively on matters of state without seeking the Diet's endless consensus. The Ten Houses will retain their ancient right to elect the monarch, ensuring no ruler can ever truly escape their influence, but the initiative and the power to govern will now rest firmly with the throne."
 mechanic_revive_public_punishments_shorter_cooldown_yes: "Reduces the cooldown of §YRevive Public Punishments§! government interaction by §G50%§!."
 great_concordat: "The Great Concordat"
