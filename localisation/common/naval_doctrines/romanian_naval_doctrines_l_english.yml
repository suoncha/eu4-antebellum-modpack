 river_wolves_doctrine: "River Wolves"
 river_wolves_doctrine_desc: "Land armies view rivers as obstacles, but to us, they are pathways for our fleets. Our ships patrol coastlines and waterways, transporting our 'River Wolves'—marines trained to swiftly storm ashore, dismantle enemy defenses, and establish secure footholds before the enemy can sound the alarm."
